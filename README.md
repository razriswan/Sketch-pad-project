**Project Description**

This project is a browser-based **Sketch Pad** built using HTML, CSS (with Flexbox), and vanilla JavaScript. The main objective is to dynamically generate a grid of square divs inside a container where users can "draw" by simply hovering over the squares. The project emphasizes DOM manipulation and the use of Flexbox to create a grid layout without relying on modern layout systems like CSS Grid. It provides a fun and interactive way to understand event handling, element creation, and layout design using foundational web development concepts.

**Key Features**

By default, the sketch pad generates a 16x16 grid, where each square changes color as the mouse hovers over it, creating a pixelated drawing effect. A button at the top of the page allows users to specify a new grid size, up to a maximum of 100 squares per side. The grid resizes dynamically while keeping the total container width constant at 960px, ensuring consistent sizing and layout. For enhanced interactivity, the project includes additional features such as random color generation and a progressive darkening effect on each square with repeated mouseover events. These features help simulate shading and create a more dynamic drawing experience.

**Conclusion**

This sketch pad project is a hands-on exercise in building interactive web interfaces using only core web technologies. It reinforces important skills such as DOM manipulation, event-driven programming, and responsive layout design with Flexbox. Beyond its educational value, the project serves as a foundation for more advanced canvas or drawing applications and provides a solid example of how user input and interactivity can be achieved without relying on frameworks or complex libraries.
